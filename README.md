# DMC LCC Sort
Many library databases have LCC call numbers stored as string literals which cannot be sorted with a simple sort since LCC reads left to right and normal sorts would go right to left. Even reversing the string, there's deficiencies.

This project will probably contain an API that takes in a file and sorts by the LCC classification system and a frontend to upload files to get sorted.
